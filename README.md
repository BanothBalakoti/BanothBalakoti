Certainly! Here's a simple HTML code snippet that includes an image tag for the cat image you provided:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Cat Image</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Cute Cat Image</h1>
    <img src="https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/tmH3RG7rD.jpg" alt="Cute Cat">

</body>
</html>
```

Replace the title and alt text as needed. This HTML code includes a title, "Cute Cat Image," and an image tag displaying the cat image from the provided URL. You can use this code as a starting point and customize it further based on your needs.- 👋 Hi, I’m @BanothBalakoti
